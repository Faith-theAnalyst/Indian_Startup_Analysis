    "## Data Understanding\n",
    "\n",
    "This project aims to explore and gain a deeper understanding of the Indian startup funding ecosystem. The dataset used for analysis contains information about startup funding from 2019 to 2021. The dataset includes various attributes such as the company's name, sector, funding amount, funding round, investor details, and location.\n",
    "\n",
    "To conduct a comprehensive analysis, we will examine the dataset to understand its structure, contents, and any potential data quality issues. By understanding the data, we can ensure the accuracy and reliability of our analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "The key attributes in the dataset include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Company**: The name of the startup receiving funding.\n",
    "- **Sector**: The industry or sector to which the startup belongs.\n",
    "- **Amount**: The amount of funding received by the startup.\n",
    "- **Stage**: The round of funding (e.g., seed, series A, series B).\n",
    "- **Location**: The city or region where the startup is based.\n",
    "- **About**: What the company does.\n",
    "- **Funding Year**:When the company was funded\n",
    "\n",
    "By examining these attributes, we can uncover insights about the funding landscape, identify trends in funding amounts and rounds, explore the preferred sectors for investment, and analyze the role of cities in the startup ecosystem.\n",
    "\n",
    "Throughout the analysis, we will use visualizations and statistical techniques to present the findings effectively. By understanding the data and its characteristics, we can proceed with confidence in our analysis, derive meaningful insights, and make informed decisions based on the findings."
